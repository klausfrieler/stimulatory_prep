Stimulus Database
-----------------
For the planned stimulus database, we need a metadata schema and a structure to represent the sets of stimuli. 
It is not sufficient to store the files individually in the database, as experimental stimuli generally come as sets.
A reasonable structure would be a tree like folder organisation of the stimui files, where stimuli belonging together (e.g., experimental condition) 
could be store in corresponding subfolders.
Examples of stimulus sets are depicted below. For example, stimulus set A would be the most basic organisation, where all stimuli of a set are stored in the 
root folder (eg musical pieces to be rated).
For stimulus set B the stimulus files for the different conditions of the experiment are stored in the corresponding subfolders (e.g., poems with +rhyme,-rhyme)
The root folder of a stimulus set must contain a metadata file to describe the stimuli in the (sub)folder(s). 
This metadata file is downloaded with the stimuli and should be machine readable (e.g., json or yaml format).

metadata in textfile (downloaded with stimulus set, generated on the fly???):
	* name/foldername of stimulusset
	* Responsible Person(s)
	* Copyright
	* Description 
		- Generell Description of the Stimuli
		- Scientific intention/use
		- Description of single/groups of stimulusfiles with reference to path
		  (e.g., in condition_1/images we used blurred versions of xxx)
			condition(x3)/sounds()
	....

metadata in data base:
	* name/foldername of stimulus set
	* Responsible Person(s)
	* Department
	* Date created   
	* Date archived
	* Copyright
	* Access permissions (e.g. OpenToPublic/InternalUse/FullyRestricted)
	* Description 
		- Scientific intention/use
